About Release 0.4.5:
====================
Bugfix release for compatability issues on Win32, among other small issues.

About Release 0.4.4:
====================
Bugfix release for poor tolerance of unsupported options in the server.

About Release 0.4.3:
====================
Bugfix release for an issue with the server's detection of the end of the file
during a download.

About Release 0.4.2:
====================
Bugfix release for some small installation issues with earlier Python
releases.

About Release 0.4.1:
====================
Bugfix release to fix the installation path, with some restructuring into a
tftpy package from the single module used previously.

About Release 0.4:
==================
This release adds a TftpServer class with a sample implementation in bin.
The server uses a single thread with multiple handlers and a select() loop to
handle multiple clients simultaneously.

Only downloads are supported at this time.

About Release 0.3:
==================
This release fixes a major RFC 1350 compliance problem with the remote TID.

About Release 0.2:
==================
This release adds variable block sizes, and general option support,
implementing RFCs 2347 and 2348. This is accessible in the TftpClient class
via the options dict, or in the sample client via the --blocksize option.

About Release 0.1:
==================

This is an initial release in the spirit of "release early, release often".
Currently the sample client works, supporting RFC 1350. The server is not yet
implemented, and RFC 2347 and 2348 support (variable block sizes) is underway,
planned for 0.2.
