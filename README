This is a simple tftp library for Python. The project has no hosting as of
yet, so for now, simply direct any problems to me at
msoulier@digitaltorque.ca.

This library was developed against Python 2.4.1. If you have a previous
version, don't bother contacting me. You're welcome to backport it if you
like.
